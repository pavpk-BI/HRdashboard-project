## ðŸ“„ Business Request (Email Style)

**From:** Maria Gomez, HR Manager  
**To:** Pavitra â€“ Business Intelligence Analyst 
**Subject:** Request for Comprehensive HR Dashboard for Workforce Insights

---

**Background:**  
As the HR Manager, Iâ€™m currently relying on fragmented spreadsheets and manual reports to track workforce data, which makes it difficult to get a clear, up-to-date picture of our employee metrics. We want to consolidate all key HR insights into one place and gain the ability to drill down into specific records.

**Request:**  
We need a comprehensive dashboard that can provide both high-level summaries and detailed employee records. The dashboard should include the following:

### Summary View (Three Sections)
1. **Overview**
   - Total number of hired, active, and terminated employees.
   - Hiring and termination trends over the years.
   - Breakdown of employees by department and job title.
   - Comparison of HQ (New York) vs branch locations.
   - Distribution of employees by city and state.

2. **Demographics**
   - Gender ratio across the organization.
   - Employee distribution by age group and education level.
   - Correlation between education background and performance ratings.

3. **Income Analysis**
   - Salary comparisons across education levels and genders.
   - Correlation of age with salary across departments.

### Employee Records View
- A full list of all employees with fields like name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
- Filtering options on all columns for custom analysis.

**Outcome:**  
The goal is to better understand our workforce, make data-driven HR decisions, and identify gaps or trends that can guide recruitment, performance management, and compensation strategies.
