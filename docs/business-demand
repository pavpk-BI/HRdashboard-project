## ðŸ“Œ Business Demand Overview

The HR department is currently relying on fragmented reports and manual data gathering methods to analyze workforce composition, hiring trends, and salary insights. This approach is time-consuming, lacks consistency, and makes it difficult for HR managers and executives to make data-driven decisions in real time.

There is a growing demand for a centralized, visual dashboard that consolidates all key HR metricsâ€”covering areas such as hiring activity, employee demographics, and income distribution. By enabling both high-level summary views and detailed employee records, the dashboard will support more effective workforce planning, diversity initiatives, and pay equity analysis.

This project aims to deliver an interactive Tableau solution that connects to HR data sources and provides intuitive visuals, KPIs, and filtering capabilities, empowering the HR team to make quicker and more informed strategic decisions.
